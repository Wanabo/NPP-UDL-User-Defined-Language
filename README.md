# NPP-UDL-User-Defined-Language
NotePad++ Custom User Defined Languages.
I couldn't find a suitable language for displaying Modsecurity related files with meaningfull highlighting.
So I defined my first custom language in NotePad++. It's a syntax highlighter for ModSecurity related files like .conf, .data, .log

Next UDL will probably for syntax highlighting for Apache and Nginx log files.

If you would like to help me improve the published UDL's, then please post an "Issue".
